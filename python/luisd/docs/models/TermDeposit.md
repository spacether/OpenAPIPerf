**flowConvention** | [**FlowConventions**](FlowConventions.md) | [**FlowConventions**](FlowConventions.md) |  | 
**instrumentType** | str,  | str,  | The available values are: QuotedSecurity, InterestRateSwap, FxForward, Future, ExoticInstrument, FxOption, CreditDefaultSwap, InterestRateSwaption, Bond, EquityOption, FixedLeg, FloatingLeg, BespokeCashFlowsLeg, Unknown, TermDeposit, ContractForDifference, EquitySwap, CashPerpetual, CapFloor, CashSettled, CdsIndex, Basket, FundingLeg, CrossCurrencySwap, FxSwap, ForwardRateAgreement, SimpleInstrument, Repo, Equity, ExchangeTradedOption | must be one of ["QuotedSecurity", "InterestRateSwap", "FxForward", "Future", "ExoticInstrument", "FxOption", "CreditDefaultSwap", "InterestRateSwaption", "Bond", "EquityOption", "FixedLeg", "FloatingLeg", "BespokeCashFlowsLeg", "Unknown", "TermDeposit", "ContractForDifference", "EquitySwap", "CashPerpetual", "CapFloor", "CashSettled", "CdsIndex", "Basket", "FundingLeg", "CrossCurrencySwap", "FxSwap", "ForwardRateAgreement", "SimpleInstrument", "Repo", "Equity", "ExchangeTradedOption", ] 
**rate** | decimal.Decimal, int, float,  | decimal.Decimal,  | The fixed rate for the term deposit. Specified as a decimal, e.g 0.03 is meant to be 3% interest | value must be a 64 bit float
**maturityDate** | str, datetime,  | str,  | The final maturity date of the instrument. This means the last date on which the instruments makes a payment of any amount.              For the avoidance of doubt, that is not necessarily prior to its last sensitivity date for the purposes of risk; e.g. instruments such as              Constant Maturity Swaps (CMS) often have sensitivities to rates beyond their last payment date | value must conform to RFC-3339 date-time
**contractSize** | decimal.Decimal, int, float,  | decimal.Decimal,  | With an OTC we have the problem of multiple ways of booking a quantity.              e.g.              If buying a swap do you have a holding of size 1 of 100,000,000 notional swap or a holding of 100,000,000 size of 1 notional swap, or any combination that multiplies to 10^8.              When you get for a price for a &#x27;unit swap&#x27; what do you mean? The definition must be consistent across all quotes. This includes bonds which have a face value and              fx-forwards which often trade in standard contract sizes. When we look up a price, and there are no units, we are assuming it is a price for a contract size of 1.              The logical effect of this is that              instrument clean price &#x3D; contract size * quoted unit price              holding clean price    &#x3D; holding quantity * instrument clean price &#x3D; holding quantity * contract size * quoted unit price              In calculating accrued interest the same should hold.              NB: The real problem is that people store \&quot;prices\&quot; without complete units. Everything should really be \&quot;x ccy for n units\&quot;. Where the n is implicit the above has to hold. | value must be a 64 bit float
**startDate** | str, datetime,  | str,  | The start date of the instrument. This is normally synonymous with the trade-date. | value must conform to RFC-3339 date-time
**any_string_name** | dict, frozendict.frozendict, str, date, datetime, int, float, bool, decimal.Decimal, None, list, tuple, bytes, io.FileIO, io.BufferedReader | frozendict.frozendict, str, BoolClass, decimal.Decimal, NoneClass, tuple, bytes, FileIO | any string name can be used but the value must be the correct type | [optional]
